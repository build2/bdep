Version 0.10.0

  * New bdep-new(1) --subdirectory mode.

    This mode can be used to create a new source subdirectory in an already
    existing project.

  * Support for more granular C++ source file extension specification in
    bdep-new(1).

    For example:

    $ bdep new -t lib -l c++,hxx=h,cxx=cpp libhello  # .h & .cpp
    $ bdep new -t lib -l c++,extension=?++           # .h++, .c++, etc

    See the bdep-new(1) man pages for details.

  * Support for suppressing the generation of the library version header.

    Specifically, the bdep-new(1) --type|-t=lib option now has the new
    no-version sub-option.

  * Support for the alternative build file/directory naming scheme.

    Specifically, the bdep-new(1) --type|-t option now has the new alt-naming
    sub-option that can be used to create projects with the alternative
    naming.

  * New bdep-release(1) --[no]-edit options.

    Now in all the bdep-release modes that perform a commit, if the project's
    repository index already contains other changes, then the commit message
    is automatically opened for editing unless --no-edit is specified. The
    editing of the commit message in the absence of other changes can be
    requested with the --edit option.

Version 0.9.0

  * New bdep-release command for managing a project's version during release.

    This command can be used to automatically change the project's version
    from snapshot to release (or the other way around), commit this change,
    tag this commit, and push everything to the remote.

    See the "Versioning and Release Management" in The build2 Toolchain
    Introduction for usage examples as well as the bdep-release(1) man pages
    for details.

  * New 'binless' option for the bdep-new 'c++' language parameter.

    This option allows creation of a simpler buildfile for header-only (and,
    in the future, for module-only) libraries. For example:

    $ bdep new -l c++,binless ...

  * New --jobs|-j option for specifying the number of jobs to perform in
    parallel.

  * CI requests from the staged toolchain are now by default sent to
    ci.stage.build2.org.

  * New --no-progress option for suppressing progress indicators.

Version 0.8.0

  * New bdep-ci command for submitting package test requests to CI servers.
    See bdep-ci(1) for details.

  * New bdep-publish command for publishing packages to archive-based
    repositories. See bdep-publish(1) for details.

  * New unit-tests project type option for the bdep-new command.

    If specified (-t exe,unit-tests or -t lib,unit-tests) then generate build
    infrastructure for unit testing.

  * Ability to suppress auto-synchronization via the BDEP_SYNC environment
    variable.

    If BDEP_SYNC is set, auto-synchronization will only be performed if its
    value is true or 1. So to suppress, run:

    $ BDEP_SYNC=0 b

Version 0.7.0

  * First public release.
