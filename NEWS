Version 0.17.0

  * New `third-party` library and executable sub-option in bdep-new.

    This sub-option is meant for converting an existing third-party project
    to build2. It automatically enables a number of other sub-options (such
    as no-version, no-readme, and no-symexport). It also adds a number of
    values to manifest that makes sense to specify in a package of a third-
    party project and, unless no-package-readme is specified, generates the
    PACKAGE-README.md template.

  * New buildfile-in-prefix library and executable sub-option in bdep-new.

  * New export-stub executable sub-option in bdep-new.

  * New no-symexport and auto-symexport library sub-options in bdep-new.

  * New no-subdir-include library sub-option in bdep-new.

Version 0.16.0

  * The bdep-deinit command can now deinitialize a package that still has
    dependents.

    In this case, the package is replaced with the closest available version
    from a repository. See also the new --no-fetch option in bdep-deinit(1).

  * New bdep-ci command --target-config and --package-config options to match
    the *-package-config package manifest values.

    Note that the existing --interactive|-i, --builds, and --build-config
    option values have been adjusted as well. See bdep-ci(1) for details.

  * The bdep-new command may now add `type` and `language` values to the newly
    created package manifests.

    These values can help determine the package type (executable, library) and
    language and are used, for example, by bpkg-pkg-bindist to produce correct
    binary distribution packages.

  * New `branch` suboption for the git vcs option in the bdep-new command.

    This suboption can be used to specify the initial branch name in the newly
    created repository.

  * New --sys-* options in the bdep-init and bdep-sync commands.

    This is a subset of the bpkg-pkg-build --sys-* options for controlling
    interaction with the system package manager. See the "System package
    manager query/installation support for Debian and Fedora" NEWS item in
    bpkg for background.

Version 0.15.0

  * Support for JSON output in the bdep-status, bdep-config-list commands.

    See the --stdout-format option in bdep-status(1) and bdep-config(1)
    for details.

  * Support for submitting to a CI server packages with a non-standard
    version.

    See bdep-ci(1) for details.

  * Support for publishing packages with a non-standard version.

    See bdep-publish(1) for details.

Version 0.14.0

  * Support for configuration types, configuration linking, and build-time
    dependencies.

    Configurations can now be linked with each other to allow a package to be
    built in one configuration while its dependencies -- in one or more linked
    configurations. This can be used to create a "base" configuration with
    common dependencies that are shared between multiple configurations.

    Configurations now also have types with the three predefined types being
    `target` (the default) `host` (used for build-time project packages and/or
    dependencies), and `build2` (used for build system modules). We can now
    also have multiple default configurations if they are of different types.
    This mechanism together with configuration linking is used to provide
    separate configurations for build-time dependencies, for example, tools
    that need to be executed or build system modules that need to be loaded
    during the build.

    If during initialization or synchronization a build-time dependency is
    encountered and there is no build configuration of a suitable type
    associated with the project, then the user is prompted to automatically
    create and associate such a configuration.

    New relevant commands: bdep-config-{link,unlink}.

    Command with relevant changes (new options, etc): bdep-config-create,
    bdep-init, bdep-sync.

    See bdep-config(1) and bdep-sync(1) for details on this functionality.
    See also the corresponding functionality in bpkg on which this support
    is based.

  * Project packages are now by default initialized for development.

    Specifically, a package is configured with config.<package>.develop=true
    unless an alternative value is specified on the command line. For example:

    $ bdep init @install config.hello.develop=false

    To change the development mode of an already initialized package, use
    bdep-sync:

    $ bdep sync @install config.hello.develop=false

    See the build system manual for details on the config.*.develop variable
    semantics.

  * Configuration of project packages is now preserved during synchronization.

    To reconfigure a package from scratch, use the new --disfigure bdep-sync
    option. For example:

    $ bdep sync config.hello.develop=false  # develop=false (new)
    $ bdep sync                             # develop=false (preserved)
    $ bdep sync --disfigure                 # develop=true  (default)

  * The bdep-new command can now create multi-language C/C++ projects.

  * The bdep-new command can now create binless (header-only) C libraries.

  * The bdep-new command now generates smarter glue buildfiles that read
    packages.manifest instead of using a directory wildcard.

  * New --immediate|-i and --recursive|-r bdep-{update,clean} options.

    These options can be used to additionally update or clean immediate or all
    dependencies of the project packages, respectively.

  * New --build-config bdep-ci option.

    This option provides an easier way to specify the desired build
    configuration or configuration pattern.

  * New --interactive|-i bdep-ci option.

    This option can be used to request an interactive CI session. In this mode
    the CI service pauses the testing at the specified breakpoint and provides
    the login information to the execution environment.

  * Support for argument grouping in bdep-{sync,init}.

    See bdep-argument-grouping(1) for details on argument grouping.

  * New BDEP_DEF_OPT environment variable that can be used to suppress loading
    of default options files.

Version 0.13.0

  * The SPDX License Expression in now the default scheme in the bdep-new
    --type|-t,license sub-option.

    Auto-detected licenses now also result in the SPDX License ID in the
    'license' package manifest value.

  * New source layout customization mechanisms in bdep-new.

    In particular, the split include/src layout is now supported out of the
    box:

    $ bdep new -l c++ -t lib,split libhello

    See the SOURCE LAYOUT section in bdep-new(1) for details and a large
    number of examples.

  * The bdep-new command in the --package mode now creates the "glue
    buildfile" for the project.

  * The bdep-new command now generates the .gitattributes file with sensible
    defaults.

  * The bdep-new --subdirectory mode option has been renamed to --source.

    The corresponding default options file has also been renamed to
    bdep-new-source.options.

  * The bdep-new binless sub-option has been moved from --lang|-l to --type|t.

Version 0.12.0

  * Support for creating new projects with existing files.

    The bdep-new command now also recognizes and handles the following
    existing filesystem entries in the project root:

      .git      -- assume VCS is already initialized and is Git
      LICENSE   -- try to guess the manifest license from contents
      README.md -- try to extract the manifest summary line from contents

    Overall, the idea is to streamline the workflow where one creates a
    project on one of the hosting services (GitHub, GitLab, etc) and then
    initializes it with bdep-new.

    Also, to this effect, specifying the project name is now optional and if
    omitted, the current working directory (or --output-dir, if specified) is
    assumed to be the project name.

    An example of this streamlined workflow:

    $ # create project with LICENSE and README.md on a Git hosting service
    $ git clone .../libhello.git
    $ cd libhello
    $ bdep new -t lib

    Finally, with this change it now makes sense to have support for pre-
    creation hooks (--pre-hook) in addition to post-creation (--post-hook).

  * Support for default options files (aka tool config files).

    See the bdep-default-options-files(1) help topic for background and the
    DEFAULT OPTIONS FILES section in each command's man pages for specifics.

  * New bdep-new no-install project type sub-option.

    In particular, this should be useful when creating *-tests packages.

  * The C library projects created by bdep-new are now portable.

    Specifically, the use of fmemopen() was replaced with tmpfile().

  * The pre and post-creation hooks now make use of portable builtins.

    To instead use a system-provided program, prefix the name with `^`, for
    example:

    $ bdep new --post-hook "^cat --squeeze-blank .../.gitignore >>.gitignore"

    See bdep-new(1) for details.

  * Ability to specify <pkg-args> in the bdep-init command's -A and -C forms.

  * Ability to keep/update/remove the current tag in the bdep-release
    command's revision mode.

    Note also that previously the default was to update while now it is to
    keep.

  * Ability to have multiple forwarded configurations.

    The new constraint is that such configurations should not have any common
    packages (a package's source directory cannot be forwarded to multiple
    configurations).

  * New bdep-submit --forward option.

    This option instructs bdep-submit to use each package's forwarded
    configuration in order to prepare the distributions. This helps with
    setups where there is no single configuration that has all the packages
    (such as a build system module project).

  * New bdep-init --no-sync option.

    This allows postponing initialization in the build configurations to a
    later explicit bdep-sync. One subtle difference with such an explicit sync
    is that it will be performed without having the project's database open,
    which can be important if the initialization triggers an implicit sync
    (via a hook) of a project that uses the same database (as is the case with
    build system module projects).

Version 0.11.0

  * The bdep-new command now by default adds a README.md template. This can be
    suppressed with the new no-readme project type sub-option. For example:

    $ bdep new -t exe,no-readme hello

  * New license=<name> bdep-new project type sub-option allows specifying a
    project license. For example:

    $ bdep new -t exe,license=MIT hello

    Commonly used license names are 'MIT', 'ASLv2' (Apache License 2.0),
    'GPLv3', and 'proprietary' (see the 'license' package manifest value
    documentation for a more extensive list of names). Note that if the
    license is not specified, the default is now 'proprietary' instead of
    'TODO'.

  * New bdep-new --post-hook option allows the execution of customization
    commands in the newly created project. For example:

    $ bdep new --post-hook "echo .idea/ >>.gitignore" hello

    See the bdep-new(1) man pages for details.

  * The bdep-ci command now allows overriding certain manifest values in
    packages being submitted for testing. This is primarily useful for
    specifying alternative build configurations and/or build notification
    emails. For example:

    $ bdep ci --builds gcc

    See the bdep-ci(1) man pages for details.

  * New bdep-release --amend and --squash options allow releasing a revision
    by squashing and amending one or more existing commits.

  * New --existing|-e option for bdep-{init,new} --config-create|-C and
    bdep-config create modes. With this option bdep initializes a bpkg
    configuration based on an existing build system configuration instead of
    creating a new one from scratch. For example:

    $ b create: build-clang/,cc config.cxx=clang++
    $ bdep new -C build-clang --existing hello

Version 0.10.0

  * New bdep-new --subdirectory mode.

    This mode can be used to create a new source subdirectory in an already
    existing project.

  * Support for more granular C++ source file extension specification in
    bdep-new.

    For example:

    $ bdep new -t lib -l c++,hxx=h,cxx=cpp libhello  # .h & .cpp
    $ bdep new -t lib -l c++,extension=?++ libhello  # .h++, .c++, etc

    See the bdep-new(1) man pages for details.

  * Support for suppressing the generation of the library version header.

    Specifically, the bdep-new --type|-t=lib option now has the new no-version
    sub-option.

  * Support for the alternative build file/directory naming scheme.

    Specifically, the bdep-new --type|-t option now has the new alt-naming
    sub-option that can be used to create projects with the alternative
    naming.

  * New bdep-release --[no]-edit options.

    Now in all the bdep-release modes that perform a commit, if the project's
    repository index already contains other changes, then the commit message
    is automatically opened for editing unless --no-edit is specified. The
    editing of the commit message in the absence of other changes can be
    requested with the --edit option.

Version 0.9.0

  * New bdep-release command for managing a project's version during release.

    This command can be used to automatically change the project's version
    from snapshot to release (or the other way around), commit this change,
    tag this commit, and push everything to the remote.

    See the "Versioning and Release Management" in The build2 Toolchain
    Introduction for usage examples as well as the bdep-release(1) man pages
    for details.

  * New 'binless' option for the bdep-new 'c++' language parameter.

    This option allows creation of a simpler buildfile for header-only (and,
    in the future, for module-only) libraries. For example:

    $ bdep new -l c++,binless ...

  * New --jobs|-j option for specifying the number of jobs to perform in
    parallel.

  * CI requests from the staged toolchain are now by default sent to
    ci.stage.build2.org.

  * New --no-progress option for suppressing progress indicators.

Version 0.8.0

  * New bdep-ci command for submitting package test requests to CI servers.
    See the bdep-ci(1) man pages for details.

  * New bdep-publish command for publishing packages to archive-based
    repositories. See the bdep-publish(1) man pages for details.

  * New unit-tests project type option for the bdep-new command.

    If specified (-t exe,unit-tests or -t lib,unit-tests) then generate build
    infrastructure for unit testing.

  * Ability to suppress auto-synchronization via the BDEP_SYNC environment
    variable.

    If BDEP_SYNC is set, auto-synchronization will only be performed if its
    value is true or 1. So to suppress, run:

    $ BDEP_SYNC=0 b

Version 0.7.0

  * First public release.
