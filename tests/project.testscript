# Create and initialize a sample build2 C++ executable project that will be
# copied by subsequent tests and scopes setup commands. The common approach
# will be that group scopes copy and modify the parent scope project as
# required by the nested tests and scopes. Tests will also clone the parent
# scope project to optionally modify it, use and cleanup at the end. Note that
# project can not be shared between multiple bdep processes. Also we need to
# make sure that projects are not cloned while being used by bdep.

# Clones the original project from the root scope working directory.
